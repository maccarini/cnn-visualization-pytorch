# CNN Visualization with PyTorch

This jupyter notebook contains the code to visualzize graphically what happens in the convolution an pooling process of a CNN. Also the effect of batch normalization is included.

## Notebook Distribution
* Package imports
* Fetch data
* Perform convolution an pooling on a sample image from the dataset
* Analyze the impact of batch normalization

## Dataset

The data used is from the fashion nmist dataset. More information on this dataset available on my [PyTorch CNN notebook](https://github.com/maccarini/pytorch-cnn) or directly 
in [Zalando's official repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

## The Code

The code is divided in two jupyter notebooks, one containing the code for the visual representation of the process and a complementary one containing the code to compare networks
performance with and without batch normalization.
